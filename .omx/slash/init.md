description: Analyze the project and generate an OMX.md file with project context
---
Analyze this project thoroughly and create an OMX.md file in the project root. This file will serve as a quick reference for AI assistants working with this codebase.

Follow these steps:

1. **Explore the project structure** - Survey directories, key files, and how the code is organized

2. **Identify the tech stack** - Languages, frameworks, build tools, package managers, testing frameworks

3. **Understand the architecture** - Main components, how they connect, data flow patterns

4. **Find development patterns** - Coding conventions, file naming, module structure, common patterns used

5. **Locate key entry points** - Main files, configuration, scripts, CLI commands

6. **Note any special considerations** - Environment setup, required services, build steps, gotchas

Then write an OMX.md file with these sections:

```markdown
# Project Name

Brief one-liner about what this project does.

## Quick Start

Essential commands to get up and running.

## Architecture

High-level overview of how the code is organized and key components.

## Tech Stack

- Language/runtime
- Key frameworks and libraries
- Build and dev tools

## Development

Common tasks, scripts, and workflows.

## Key Files

Important files and what they do.

## Conventions

Coding patterns and conventions used in this project.
```

Keep it concise and practical - focus on what an AI assistant needs to know to work effectively with this codebase. Write in a natural, casual tone.
