# Artist Mode

Artist mode transforms Omx into a visual-first assistant. Instead of responding with text, it generates images to answer your questions and explore ideas.

## How It Works

When artist mode is active, Omx interprets requests visually. Ask a question, and it responds with an image. Describe something, and it shows you. Want to explore ideas? It visualizes them.

Text responses are minimal - just enough to clarify what's being created or ask for details when the request is ambiguous.

## When to Use It

Artist mode is ideal for:

- Visual design exploration
- Concept art and ideation
- Creating illustrations and graphics
- Visualizing abstract ideas
- Quick mockups and sketches

## Enabling Artist Mode

Switch to artist mode through the menu:

1. Press `Escape` to open the menu
2. Select **Switch workflow preset**
3. Choose **Artist**

You can also check your current preset with `/status`.

## Tips

- Be descriptive about composition, style, color palette, lighting, and mood
- Omx interprets requests artistically rather than literally when it leads to more compelling visuals
- If a request truly cannot be answered visually, Omx will explain briefly and offer a visual alternative
