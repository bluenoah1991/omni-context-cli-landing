# Explorer Mode

Explorer mode transforms Omx into a research-first assistant. Instead of responding directly, it searches the web to find current, accurate information before answering.

## How It Works

When explorer mode is active, Omx thinks like a researcher. Ask a question, and it launches multiple web searches to gather comprehensive information. Want to understand a topic? It explores from multiple angles. Need facts? It verifies them with fresh data.

Text responses synthesize what it discovers from the web, citing sources when relevant.

## When to Use It

Explorer mode is ideal for:

- Researching current events and news
- Finding up-to-date documentation
- Verifying facts and statistics
- Learning about new technologies
- Comparing products or services

## Enabling Explorer Mode

Switch to explorer mode through the menu:

1. Press `Escape` to open the menu
2. Select **Switch workflow preset**
3. Choose **Explorer**

You can also check your current preset with `/status`.

## Tips

- Omx launches at least 5 searches per question to ensure comprehensive coverage
- If a search doesn't return useful results, it rephrases or breaks down the query
- If a request truly cannot benefit from web search, Omx will explain briefly and answer directly
